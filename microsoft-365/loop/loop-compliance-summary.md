# Summary of governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities for Loop

As a Compliance Manager or IT administrator, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest governance, data lifecycle, and compliance posture for the software solutions being used in your organization. This article details the capabilities available and not available yet for [Microsoft Loop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop).

## Summary table of admin management, governance, lifecycle, and compliance capabilities based on where Loop content is stored

<sup>\*</sup> If you need to specify an individual Loop workspace for a retention policy or another compliance feature, specify the workspace as you would a SharePoint site, by its URL. To locate this URL, sign in to the SharePoint admin center with the [SharePoint Embedded administrator role](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/adminrole). Then navigate to **Containers** > **Active containers** or **Deleted containers** where you can view the details of a selected Loop workspace. From the flyout pane, **General** tab, copy the container URL.

## Summary of governance, data lifecycle, and compliance capabilities **not yet available**

### Available admin capabilities

For detailed information on existing capabilities in SharePoint Admin Center and PowerShell:
  - Available: [Manage SharePoint Embedded containers in SharePoint Admin Center](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/consuming-tenant-admin/ctaux)
  - Available: [SharePoint Embedded container management in PowerShell](/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/admin-exp/consuming-tenant-admin/ctapowershell)

### Not yet available

The following sections detail capabilities that are **not yet available** for Microsoft Loop to make it easier to evaluate the smaller list of capabilities your organization might require before using Microsoft Loop. As denoted in the summary table, the content applies to Loop workspaces only.

### Admin Management not yet available

- When users delete an entire Loop workspace, that Loop workspace isn't available in an **end-user visible Recycle bin**. Furthermore, restoring the Loop workspace using admin tooling doesn't update in the Loop app user experience. The user would need to visit a saved page link for a restored workspace in order to see it again. Microsoft Roadmap ID 421615 addresses this.
- When an **admin deletes** a Loop workspace, it **will not be removed from the user's view** of Loop workspaces. When users click on the deleted Loop workspace, it displays an error. Microsoft Roadmap ID 421613 addresses this.
- When an **admin modifies the list of owners or members** of a Loop workspace through the SharePoint Admin Center or via PowerShell, the **changes won't be visible to the users within that Loop workspace**. Changes to the workspace membership are only updated in the user's view of the Loop app if they're made directly within the Loop app itself. Microsoft Roadmap ID 421613 addresses this.
- All shared Loop workspaces, including Ideas, are created as tenant-owned, in the tenant default geo like SharePoint Communication sites, not in the creator's preferred data location. Copilot Pages is created as user-owned, in the geo that matches the user's preferred data location. See [storage management after user departure](/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-storage-permission#storage-management-after-user-departure) for more information on managing workspaces. Microsoft Roadmap ID 422729 addresses Ideas functioning as a shared Loop workspace.
- **Individual controls for guest or external sharing** of a specific Loop workspace isn't available. Microsoft Roadmap ID 421614 addresses this.

### eDiscovery capabilities not yet available
- Full text search of content within .loop files in review sets.

### Microsoft 365 retention and deletion capabilities not available
- Retention labels can't be applied to workspaces (this is by design, not a Loop limitation) and an end-user experience to apply, view, or update a retention label for components and pages isn't yet available. Microsoft Roadmap ID 397755 addresses this.

## Managing Loop in your organization

By reviewing this information, you can make an informed decision on whether Microsoft Loop is ready for use as a software solution in your organization. As always, we continue to update this and other documentation to provide the compliance status of Microsoft Loop to help you make the best decisions for your organization.
