# Microsoft 365 reports in the admin center – Microsoft Copilot (enterprise data protection) usage

The Microsoft Copilot usage dashboard provides insights into active usage of Microsoft Copilot with enterprise data protection. The report includes total active users, average daily active users, and active users per app (for example, Microsoft 365 App and Microsoft Edge). Usage insights can be viewed as totals and trends for the past 7, 30, 90, or 180-day periods. The report also shows the last activity date per user, anonymized by default. To view all reports, check out [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center overview](activity-reports.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The report is currently limited to just the usage of Microsoft Copilot in the Microsoft 365 App, Microsoft Edge, and to users with a Microsoft 365 license. Additional apps will be added over time. In addition, the earliest date on which usage history is available for this report is September 15th, 2024.
