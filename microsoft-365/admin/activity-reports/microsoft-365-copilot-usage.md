# Microsoft 365 reports in the admin center – Microsoft 365 Copilot usage

The Microsoft 365 Usage dashboard shows you the activity overview across the Microsoft 365 productivity apps in your organization. It enables you to drill into individual product-level reports to give you more granular insight about the activities within each app. To view all reports, check out the [Reports overview article](activity-reports.md).

In the Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report, which is in continuous enhancement, you can view a summary of how users' adoption, retention, and engagement are with Microsoft 365 Copilot, and the activity of every Copilot user in your organization, including agent usage. For Copilot activity on a given day, the report becomes available within 72 hours of the end of that day (in UTC).

## How do I get to the Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report?

1. In the admin center, go to **Reports** > **Usage**.
1. Select the **Microsoft 365 Copilot** page.
1. Select the Usage tab to view adoption and usage metrics.

## Make the user-specific data anonymous

By default, usernames and display names in Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report are anonymous. And global administrator can update settings to unconceal usernames and display name.

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to the **Settings** > **Org Settings**, and under the **Services** tab, choose **Reports**.

2. Select **Reports**, and then update the setting “Display Concealed user, group and site names in all reports”.
3. Select **Save changes**.

## FAQ

### How is a user considered active in Microsoft 365 Copilot usage?

A user is considered active in a given app if they performed an intentional action for an AI-powered capability. For example, if a user selects the Copilot icon in the Word ribbon to open the Copilot chat pane, this does not count towards active usage. However, if the user interacts with the chat pane by submitting a prompt, this action would count towards active usage.

### What's the difference between the user activity table and audit log?

The audit log data that powers Microsoft Purview solutions, such as Data Security Posture Management for AI (prevoius called AI Hub), are built for data security and compliance purposes, and provide comprehensive visibility into Copilot interactions for these use cases (for example, to discover data oversharing risks or to collect interactions for regulatory compliance or legal purposes). They are not, however, intended to be used as the basis for Copilot usage reporting. Any aggregated metrics that customers build on top of this data, such as "prompt count" or "active user count," may not be consistent with the corresponding data points in the official Copilot usage reports provided by Microsoft. Microsoft cannot provide guidance on how to use audit log data as the basis for usage reporting, nor can Microsoft guarantee that aggregated usage metrics built on top of audit log data will match similar usage metrics reported in other tools.

To access accurate information on Microsoft 365 Copilot usage, use one of the following reports: the [Microsoft 365 Copilot usage report](microsoft-365-copilot-usage.md) in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or the [Copilot Dashboard](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard) in Viva Insights.

### What's the scope of the user-level table?

The user-level table in the report is configured to show all users who were licensed for Microsoft 365 Copilot at any point over the past 180 days, even if the user has since had the license removed or never had any Copilot active usage.

### I assigned the Microsoft 365 Copilot license to users, but why is 'last activity date' for users empty in rare cases?

Based on system constraints, some users may not have a 'last activity date' in the user-level table of the report under the following conditions:

1. The user used Microsoft 365 Copilot within a short time window (less than 24 hours) after the Microsoft 365 Copilot license was assigned.
2. The user subsequently had no other Microsoft 365 Copilot usage up to the date on which the report is viewed.

### Why is the 'Last activity date of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or Outlook Copilot (UTC)' sometimes blank or newer than the actual date, even when users have recently used Copilot features?

This may be caused by a known limitation: the uploading of client events data for Copilot features in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook can be delayed for various reasons, such as when end users disconnect from the internet immediately after taking a Copilot action.

### How do the numbers in this report compare to what is shown in the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard in Viva Insights?

The data in these reports is based on the same underlying definitions of active usage, but the population of users included in the analysis and the timeframe displayed may differ. To learn more, see [Use Microsoft Copilot Dashboard advanced features with a Viva Insights subscription](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard-advanced-features#setup-and-licenses).
